# MyBookshop: A Modern Online Bookstore
Welcome to MyBookshop, a modern and responsive online bookstore web application built with React and pure CSS. This project demonstrates a basic e-commerce flow tailored for books, including book listing, book details, a shopping cart, and a simple checkout process.

# âœ¨ Features
Modern UI: Clean, minimalist, and visually appealing design using pure CSS.

Responsive Layout: Adapts beautifully to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Book Listing: Browse through a grid of featured and all available books.

Book Detail Page: View detailed information about each book (e.g., author, genre, description).

Shopping Cart: Add, update quantities, and remove books from your cart.

Dynamic Cart Count: See the number of books in your cart directly in the header.

Dummy Login Page: A placeholder for user authentication (no backend integration yet).

Simple Checkout Flow: Navigate from cart to a basic checkout confirmation.

Order Confirmation: Get an alert upon successful order placement and cart clearance.

Local Storage Integration: Cart items persist even after refreshing the page.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router DOM: For declarative routing within the application.

Pure CSS: All styling is done using plain CSS, focusing on maintainability and performance.

Vite: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
(Note: If you're using Create React App, you can replace 'Vite' with 'Create React App')

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
